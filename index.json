I joined the Tong Class (an AGI program founded by Prof. Song-Chun Zhu), being a member and the monitor in the class of 2021.\nI am currently a research intern at General Vision Lab, BIGAI. I am grateful to be advised by Dr. Zan Wang and Dr. Siyuan Huang.\nMy research interests lie in computational neuroscience, cognitive neuroscience and complexity science. My long-term goal is to understand the universal principles of self-organization and emergence within complex systems, and to leverage these principles to create the next generation of artificial intelligence.\nIn my view, this journey to General Artificial Intelligence requires the integration of four major modules: perception, memory, learning, and decision-making. This is a long journey, and I firmly believe that the breakthrough for the first step of this journey lies in vision.\nCurrently, I am focusing on human-scene interaction and generative modeling.\n","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"term","lang":"en","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"2525497d367e79493fd32b198b28f040","permalink":"","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"","section":"authors","summary":"I am Jingze Zhang, a third-year undergraduate student in Department of Automation, Tsinghua University (THU), Beijing.
